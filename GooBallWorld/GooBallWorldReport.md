# Silly Goo Bit

1. Name: Silly Goo Bit
2. Occurrence: 1995
3. Where: A very exhausted parent fell asleep while his children were playing with Silly Putty. When he woke up, his computer was all covered in Silly Putty, and bits of the Putty had gained life after being exposed to electricity. The screen was full of them.
4. Characteristics: When a silly goo bit is created, it tries to find other goo bits close by and connect to them. If it can't find any, it will wander around, waiting for one to appear close to it.
